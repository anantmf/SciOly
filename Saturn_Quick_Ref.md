## Ring Formation and Age

**Age Debate**:

- **Cassini evidence**: Rings may be young (only 100-200 million years old)

**Possible Origins**:

2. Captured and disrupted comet/meteor
3. Recent moon collision
4. Recent capture event

**Supporting Young Rings Theory**:
- Low amount of external dust on ring particles
- Ring particle properties suggest recent origin
- Limited time for weathering and darkening

## Ring Resonances Explained

### What is an Orbital Resonance?
When two bodies have orbital periods in a simple integer ratio, their gravitational interactions create patterns that affect orbits.

**2:1 Resonance Example** (Cassini Division):
- Ring particles complete 2 orbits while Mimas completes 1
- Cumulative gravitational nudges destabilize particle orbits
- Result: Gap cleared of particles

**Types of Resonances**:
- **Clearing resonances**: Create gaps
- **Stabilizing resonances**: Maintain ring structures
- **Density wave resonances**: Create spiral patterns
- **Vertical resonances**: Affect north-south motion

2. **Liquid Hydrogen Layer** (~23,000 km thick)
   - Begins at ~1 kilobar pressure, 1,000 K temperature
   - Hydrogen exists as liquid due to extreme pressure

3. **Metallic Hydrogen Layer** (~20,000 km thick)

- Draw quick diagrams to help organize your thoughts
- If a question asks about Saturn vs. another planet, use comparison table from notes
- For descriptive questions, provide specific details with proper units
- Double-check numerical answers for reasonable magnitude

**Remember**: This is a study event, not a hands-on event. Your knowledge and ability to explain concepts is what matters!
